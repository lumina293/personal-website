# My 14-Day JavaScript Journey: Building a Family Finance Dashboard

## My Goal

To learn JavaScript fundamentals by building a personal financial dashboard that can analyze and visualize family
spending across multiple accounts. My ultimate goal isn't to become a Software Engineer, but to equip myself with
technical fundamentals so that I can collaborate more efficiently with engineers in my upcoming journey as an IT
Business Analyst.

### Supports (My unfair advantages)

Starting from zero, this plan wouldn't be possible without direct mentorship from my husband, a seasoned software
engineer. He set up the boilerplate, so I could jump straight into coding and see immediate results. He's always
available to explain technical concepts in terms I understand best. I also leverage free AI tools like Deepseek,
ChatGPT, and Copilot as learning companions.

## The Stack

- **Language:** JavaScript
- **Framework:** Next.js (with help on setup)
- **Data Source:** Excel/CSV files
- **Visualization:** Charting library
